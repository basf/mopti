Opti is a Python package for specifying problems in a number of closely related fields, including experimental design, multiobjective optimization, decision making and Bayesian optimization.

### Why opti? 
Opti ...
* supports mixed continuous, discrete and categorical parameter spaces for system inputs and outputs,
* separates objectives (minimize, maximize, close-to-target) from the outputs on which they operate,
* supports different specific and generic constraints as well as black-box output constraints,
* provides sampling methods for constrained mixed variable spaces,
* json-serializes problems for use in RESTful APIs and json/bson DBs, and
* provides a range of benchmark problems for (multi-objective) optimization and Bayesian optimization.

**Note:** We are developing a successor of opti called [BoFire](https://github.com/experimental-design/bofire).
